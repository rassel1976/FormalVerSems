In reality it's not a an easy task to create a quantum computer. It's main parts: atoms, photons, or specially crafted microstructures, storing data in so called qubits(quantum bytes), whose  feature is that they should satisfy 2 contridicting conditions. From one side, they should be isolated enough from any external impacts, which can break computing process. From other side, they should have an abillity to interact with other qubits. Besides, it's necessary to have an opportunity to measure final state of cubits and show the results of computing.
	Scientists from all over the world are using several approaches to create first prototypes of quantum computers. Researches of article authors are dedicated to processing of information using single-charged positive ions - atoms withoun one electron. In their experiments, they used electric fields, created by
